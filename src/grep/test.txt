CI/CD basics
Sadly... If something is always done 'manually', it will either work poorly or not work at all.
CI/CD is a set of principles and practices that enable more frequent and secure deployment of software changes.
Reasons for using CI/CD:

Team development
Long software life cycle
Shortened release cycle
Difficulties in deployment and testing of large systems
Human factor

CD basics
CD (Continuous Delivery) is a continuous integration extension, as it automatically deploys all code changes to the test and/or production environment after the build stage.
CD can perform the following tasks.

PUBLISH (If using a deployment docker)

Build container images
Push the images to where they will be taken from for deployment


UPDATE CONFIGS

Update configuration on the machines


DEPLOY STAGING

Deployment of test environment for manual tests, QA, and other non-automated checks
Can be run manually or automatically if CI stages are passed successfully


DEPLOY PRODUCTION

Deploying a new version of the system on 'production'
This stage better be run manually rather than automatically
If you want, you can set it up for a specific branch of the repository only (master, release, etc.)



- There you go. If you have any questions, run what I said slowly through your head. I'll be right back.
